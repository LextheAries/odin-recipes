            <h2>Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth With This DIY Frozen Dessert</h2>
                <p>I needed a sweetened condensed milk for Snow Ice Cream when we were snowed in and couldn't get to the store. I didn't have the right ingredients for any recipe I found so I improvised my own. This made the best Snow Ice Cream we ever ate!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>½ cup milk</li>
                    <li>10 tablespoons powdered French vanilla-flavored coffee creamer</li>
                    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>24 cups clean fresh snow, or as needed</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk the milk, powdered creamer, and sugar together in a saucepan, and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, and cook until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Set the mixture aside, and cool thoroughly (mixture will thicken as it cools).</li>
                    <li>Place half the snow into a large mixing bowl, and pour the milk mixture over the snow. Gently stir the snow with the milk mixture until thoroughly combined. Continue to spoon in more snow, about 1 cup at a time, until the snow ice cream has the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Serve immediately.</li>
